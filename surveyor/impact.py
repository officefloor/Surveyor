"""Change-impact computation for one file within one commit.

cost(unit)    = max(WMC_other, 1) * CC * max(1, dlines)
  WMC_other   = sum CC of the OTHER units sharing the unit's container, measured on
                the PRE-change (before) container by default (`wmc_context`), so a unit
                added to a brand-new container costs ~CC*dlines while a method accreted
                onto an existing class is still charged for the siblings already there.
mutation_cost = sum cost over modified/renamed existing units
godclass_cost = sum cost over new units (new files + new methods)

The commit-level composite multiplies (mutation+godclass) by files_changed; that
spread term is applied by the caller, which knows the whole commit.

Rename handling is intentionally LIGHT for round one: match after-vs-before units
by exact name first, then a single greedy token-set Jaccard pass over the leftovers.
Cross-file moves are not chased. Refine against real exceptions later.
